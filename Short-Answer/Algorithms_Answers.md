#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) --> the first operation is n^3 but a is building up by n^2.  by dividing n^3 from n^2 we get O(n) 

b) O(n log n) --> the first loop is o(n) because its a pure iteration with no modifiers. The second loop (while loop) is log n because j grows at an  extremely fast rate with j *= 2 (growing to end the loop faster not slower).  This is what log n is.  When nested loops like this we multiple O(n) and O(log n) to get O(n log n)


c) O(n) --> this is similar to a for loop as we're iterating backwards by -1 til we hit the base case of 0.
